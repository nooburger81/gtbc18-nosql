  ## Description
  This app was created for friends who like friends and want to have their friends write thoughts and be able to see other people's thoughts. And then, they could decide to delete or keep those thoughts, forever. 

  ## Installation
  Open file inside your favorite text editor, run npm install inside the terminal, run nodemon server.js to begin the server. Once connected, you can use Postman or Insomnia to browse your friends database.

  ## Usage
  I suppose if I ever felt the normal way I keep track of my friends would fail someday, then I could use this to always know how many friends I ever had...
